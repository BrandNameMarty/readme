# readme
For viewers of my profile:
What appears to be an empty github is in fact one that is full of private repositories. These repos, as determined in Rice Universities honor code, must remain private as they could be treated as an answer key to those currently taking courses I have already completed.

For more information on my projects and repositories, please email me at either
mb@rice.edu  or  martybrandwein@gmail.com.
